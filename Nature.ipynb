Which neighborhoods have the most trees, and which neighborhoods have the most water features?

    "I, personally, like to be close to nature. I have a tree right outside my window. Due to the power of math, we were able to determine the density of trees and water in differing communities in Pittsburgh, and compare them. By calculating the number of trees and water features in each respective community, we were able to divide it by the square mileage to get something that was a little more representative. In the end, I concluded that the most natural community in Pittsburgh is **Friendship.**"
